    },
    {
      when: R`you are given \(P(B)\) and \(P(A \mid B)\) and asked for the overlap`,
      use: R`Multiplication rule \(P(A \cap B) = P(B)P(A \mid B)\)`,
      why: R`Same identity read left to right instead of right to left. Which of the two events you condition on is whichever conditional you were handed.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`draws one at a time without replacement; "then", "and then"`,
      use: R`Chain rule`,
      why: R`Multiply conditionals along the sequence, updating the pool after each draw. No binomial coefficient: a specific order was asked for.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`the population splits into groups with <em>different rates</em>, and an overall rate is wanted`,
      use: R`LOTP \(P(B) = \sum_i P(B \mid A_i)P(A_i)\)`,
      why: R`You are running the rule <b>forwards</b>: weight each group's rate by how common the group is. The groups must partition the space.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`the evidence is already observed and you want the cause — "given it tested positive, …"`,
      use: R`Bayes' rule`,
      why: R`You are running it <b>backwards</b>. The denominator is nearly always LOTP, so do that first, then divide the one joint probability you care about by it.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`the prior is given as odds, or only a likelihood <em>ratio</em> is given`,
      use: R`Odds form of Bayes`,
      why: R`Posterior odds = likelihood ratio × prior odds — a multiplication with no denominator to compute. Convert back with \(P = \text{odds}/(1+\text{odds})\).`,
    },
    {
      when: R`"independently", separate components, repeated trials of the same experiment`,
      use: R`Multiply: \(P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)\)`,
      why: R`Independence is what licenses multiplying <em>unconditional</em> probabilities. Complements of independent events are independent too.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`"at least one works / fails / arrives" with independent parts`,
      use: R`\(1 - \prod (1 - p_i)\)`,
      why: R`Parallel systems fail only when every part fails, and independent failures multiply. Series systems are the mirror image: \(\prod p_i\).`,
    },
    {
      when: R`you are asked <em>whether</em> two events are independent`,
      use: R`Test \(P(A \cap B) \stackrel{?}{=} P(A)P(B)\)`,
      why: R`It is an arithmetic check on three numbers, not something the story tells you. Disjoint events are the classic trap: they are dependent, not independent.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`"among those who…", "restrict attention to…" — a background condition fixed for the whole question`,
      use: R`LOTP or Bayes <em>with extra conditioning</em>`,
      why: R`Fix \(E\) and \(P(\cdot \mid E)\) is an ordinary probability function, so both rules apply unchanged — but \(E\) must ride along in every term, and the weights are \(P(A_i \mid E)\), not \(P(A_i)\).`,
    },
    {
      when: R`a rare condition plus an accurate test, and the answer "feels" obviously high`,
      use: R`Check the base rate`,
      why: R`With a rare cause, most positives are false positives. Trusting the sensitivity and ignoring \(P(A)\) is the single most common error in the chapter.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`"given that the first is…" vs "given that at least one is…" vs "given that \(R_1\) is one of them"`,
      use: R`Condition on <em>exactly</em> the stated event, then count or use the definition`,
      why: R`These are different events with different probabilities. "At least one" rules out the least, so it moves the answer the least; naming a specific item or position is stronger information.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`sensitivity, specificity, "overall success rate", "accuracy"`,
      use: R`LOTP: \(\text{sens}\cdot P(D) + \text{spec}\cdot P(D^c)\)`,
      why: R`Accuracy averages the two rates by prevalence. For a rare disease "call everyone healthy" scores \(P(D^c)\) — compare against that, then solve the inequality for the unknown rate.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`several observations that are independent <em>given</em> a hidden cause (children of one mother, repeated tests of one patient)`,
      use: R`Condition on the cause first; multiply likelihoods inside each case`,
      why: R`The observations are conditionally independent but not independent, so never multiply their unconditional probabilities. Updating one observation at a time gives the same posterior as all at once.`,
    },
