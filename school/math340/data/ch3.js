/* ============================================================
 * Chapter 3 — Random Variables and Their Distributions  (Week 3)
 * Source: class lecture notes (C3, both halves) + Blitzstein & Hwang
 *         ch. 3 and §4.3, §4.7
 * Covers: random variables, PMFs, CDFs, Bernoulli & Binomial,
 *         Hypergeometric, Binomial vs Hypergeometric, Discrete Uniform,
 *         functions of a random variable, independence of r.v.s and
 *         indicator random variables; Geometric, Negative Binomial and
 *         Poisson (B&H 4.3, 4.7 — second half of the C3 notes);
 *         the Binomial → Poisson limit, functions of two r.v.s, and the
 *         full independence definitions (complete C3 deck); the final
 *         pass over the deck added the Bernoulli examples (a rate, a
 *         win-loss record, a series of games) and the numbered-range
 *         uniforms (dorm-room lottery, choosing a partner).

      use: R`Define the r.v., list its support, then find the PMF`,
      why: R`\(\{X = x\}\) is an event: the outcomes that \(X\) sends to \(x\). Count those outcomes (or use a named distribution). Writing the support first catches impossible values.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`a PMF with an unknown constant \(c\), or a missing table entry`,
      use: R`\(\sum_x p_X(x) = 1\)`,
      why: R`That is the only condition that involves \(c\). Also check that no value comes out negative.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`"at least", "more than", "at most", "fewer than", "between"`,
      use: R`Translate to \(\ge, >, \le, <\) first, then add PMF values`,
      why: R`Most lost marks on PMF questions come from the endpoint. For a count, "more than 2" starts at 3. Use the complement when it has fewer terms.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`"at least \(j\) do <em>not</em>…" when \(X\) counts those who do`,
      use: R`Rewrite with \(n - X\)`,
      why: R`\(n - X \ge j \iff X \le n - j\). Change the event, not the table.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`a CDF is given and you want \(P(X = x)\)`,
      use: R`Jump size \(F(x) - F(x^-)\)`,
      why: R`The value \(F(x)\) itself is cumulative. A point with no jump has probability \(0\).`,
    },
    {
      when: R`a CDF is given and you want an interval probability`,
      use: R`\(P(a < X \le b) = F(b) - F(a)\); adjust endpoints with \(F(\cdot^-)\)`,
      why: R`Including the left endpoint means subtracting \(F(a^-)\). Excluding the right endpoint means using \(F(b^-)\). Upper tails: \(1 - F(a)\).`,
    },
    {
      when: R`one trial recorded as success/failure, win/lose, "record whether…"; a stated rate or a win–loss record`,
      use: R`\(X \sim \text{Bern}(p)\): \(X\) is the indicator of the success event`,
      why: R`\(P(X = 1) = p\), \(P(X = 0) = 1 - p\), and that is the whole PMF. A stated rate <em>is</em> \(p\); a record only <em>estimates</em> it (\(88\)–\(66\) gives \(p \approx 88/154\)) under the assumptions of constant \(p\) and independent trials. Several such trials turn the count into \(\text{Bin}(n, p)\).`,

      use: R`\(\text{Bin}(n, p)\): \(\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\)`,
      why: R`Check all four conditions (fixed \(n\), two outcomes, independent, constant \(p\)). A rate such as "8 out of 16" is how \(p\) is given.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`Binomial with "at least one", or "at least \(k\)" for small \(k\)`,
      use: R`Complement: \(1 - P(X \le k - 1)\)`,
      why: R`\(P(X \ge 1) = 1 - (1-p)^n\) is one term instead of \(n\).`,
    },

      use: R`\(\text{HGeom}(w, b, n)\): \(\binom{w}{k}\binom{b}{n-k} / \binom{w+b}{n}\)`,
      why: R`The draws are dependent: the success chance given the earlier draws changes. Check the support \(\max(0, n-b) \le k \le \min(n, w)\) before computing.`,

      when: R`an urn, but "with replacement", "put back", or a population so large it doesn't matter`,
      use: R`Binomial with \(p = \frac{w}{w+b}\)`,
      why: R`With replacement the urn is unchanged before every draw, so the draws are independent with constant \(p\). That is what separates Binomial from Hypergeometric. Without replacement from a huge population the draws are only nearly independent, so the Binomial is then an <em>approximation</em> to the exact Hypergeometric.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`"chosen at random" from a finite list, with nothing to tell the items apart`,
      use: R`Discrete Uniform: \(P(X = x) = 1/|C|\)`,
      why: R`Every probability collapses to a count: \(P(X \in A) = |A|/|C|\). But check it really is the <em>values</em> that are equally likely — the total of two dice is not uniform even though the 36 rolls are.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`equally likely values numbered from \(a\) to \(b\) (rooms 301–335, partners 2–9)`,
      use: R`\(|C| = b - a + 1\), then \(P(X \in A) = |A| / |C|\)`,
      why: R`The support does not start at 1, so count it rather than reading off the last label: \(301, \dots, 335\) is \(35\) rooms. Count the favourable values the same way (the even rooms are \(302, \dots, 334\): \(17\) of them).`,
    },
    {
      when: R`a new r.v. is built from an old one: \(Y = g(X)\), \(X^2\), \(|X|\), \(\min(X, c)\)`,
      use: R`\(P(Y = y) = \sum_{x : g(x) = y} P(X = x)\)`,
      why: R`Gather every \(x\) that \(g\) sends to \(y\) and add their probabilities. If \(g\) is one-to-one nothing pools; if it is not, the support shrinks and probabilities combine.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`two r.v.s and a joint probability, or "independent", or "i.i.d."`,
      use: R`Factor: \(P(X = x, Y = y) = P(X = x)P(Y = y)\)`,
      why: R`Independence is what licenses multiplying. To <em>disprove</em> it, one pair that fails to factor is enough; to establish it you need every pair. Draws without replacement are identically distributed but dependent.`,

    {
      when: R`counting how many of several events happen`,
      use: R`A sum of indicators, \(X = \sum_i I_{A_i}\)`,
      why: R`\(I_A I_B = I_{A \cap B}\) and \(I_A^2 = I_A\). When the \(A_i\) are independent with common probability \(p\), that sum <em>is</em> \(\text{Bin}(n, p)\).`,
    },
    {
      when: R`"until the first success", "the \(n\)th person is the first…", "keeps trying until…"`,
      use: R`\(\text{Geom}(p)\): \(P(X = k) = q^kp\), counting <b>failures</b>; tail \(P(X \ge k) = q^k\)`,
      why: R`Decide first whether the question counts failures or trials — "the 8th is the first success" is \(X = 7\). Tails and the CDF need no infinite sum: \(X \ge k\) just means the first \(k\) tries all fail.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`"already failed \(m\) times — how many more?"`,
      use: R`Memorylessness: \(P(X \ge m + k \mid X \ge m) = q^k\)`,
      why: R`Independent trials don't remember past failures, so the conditioning just restarts the count.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`"before the \(r\)th success", "the 3rd sale happens on call 12"`,
      use: R`\(\text{NBin}(r, p)\): \(\binom{n + r - 1}{r - 1}p^rq^n\)`,
      why: R`The number of successes is fixed and the trials are not — the reverse of the Binomial. The last trial is forced to be the \(r\)th success, so only \(n + r - 1\) positions are free.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`a count of events in a time window or region, "at a rate of \(\lambda\) per hour"`,
      use: R`\(\text{Pois}(\lambda)\): \(e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k/k!\)`,
      why: R`First rescale \(\lambda\) to the window asked about (rate × length). "At least one" and "more than \(k\)" are infinite tails — go through the complement.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`Binomial with huge \(n\) and tiny \(p\) (rare defects, rare events)`,
      use: R`Poisson approximation with \(\lambda = np\)`,
      why: R`The Binomial coefficients become unwieldy; the Poisson is accurate when \(n\) is large and \(p\) small.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`"is \(X\) discrete or continuous?"`,
      use: R`Ask whether the values can be <b>listed</b>`,
      why: R`Finite or countably infinite (\(1, 2, 3, \dots\)) means discrete, even if the values are decimals like tax rates. All numbers in an interval, with \(P(X = c) = 0\), means continuous.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`\(\text{Bin}(n, \lambda/n)\) with \(n \to \infty\), or "derive the Poisson PMF"`,
      use: R`Limit: bracket \(\to 1\), \((1 - \lambda/n)^n \to e^{-\lambda}\)`,
      why: R`With \(np = \lambda\) fixed, the Binomial PMF converges to \(e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k/k!\). The same fact justifies the Poisson approximation for large \(n\) and small \(p\).`,
    },
    {
      when: R`an event about two r.v.s together: \(X > Y\), \(XY = z\), \(X + Y = s\), \(\max(X, Y)\)`,
      use: R`List the pairs \((x, y)\) in the event; add \(P(X = x)P(Y = y)\) if independent`,
      why: R`\(g(X, Y)\) is a new r.v. whose PMF pools every pair \(g\) sends to the same value. For comparisons, condition on one variable: \(\sum_x P(X = x)P(Y \lt x)\).`,
    },
    {
      when: R`\(\max\) or \(\min\) of several independent r.v.s`,
      use: R`Turn it into an "all" event, then multiply`,
      why: R`\(\max \le m\) means every \(X_i \le m\); \(\min \ge m\) means every \(X_i \ge m\). By independence that is a product of \(n\) factors.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`\(2X\) vs. \(X_1 + X_2\), or "they have the same distribution"`,
      use: R`Keep the r.v. and its distribution separate`,
      why: R`\(P(2X = 2x) = P(X = x)\): doubling moves values, not probabilities. Two i.i.d. copies add differently, and \(Y = 7 - X\) has the same distribution as \(X\) without being equal to it.`,
    },
    {
      when: R`"are \(f(X, Y)\) and \(h(X, Y)\) independent?" or "are \(g(X)\) and \(h(Y)\) independent?"`,
      use: R`Theorem 3.8.5 if each uses one variable; otherwise find one failing pair`,
      why: R`Functions of separate independent r.v.s stay independent. \(X + Y\) and \(X - Y\) share both inputs: one pair of values whose joint probability doesn't factor proves dependence.`,
